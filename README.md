# Network Intrusion Detection System using Machine Learning
This project is an implementation of a network intrusion detection system (NIDS) using machine learning. The system analyzes network traffic and detects anomalies that may indicate a security breach. The model used for this project is trained on the KDD CUP'99 Dataset.
